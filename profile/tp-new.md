# Template Repositories

This document explains how to create "template" repositories. These repositories serve as a base or template that allows developers to create applications from a solid foundation, with the main features already implemented and integrated.

## What is a template repository?

A "template" repository is a base working template aimed at helping developers start projects that follow common patterns and best practices. These templates are useful for avoiding the repeated effort of setting up projects from scratch while ensuring that essential functionalities are already implemented and integrated.

### Features of a template repository:

- **Solid foundation**: Contains the basic structure and initial project configurations.
- **Integrated functionalities**: Includes the key features commonly used in specific types of applications.
- **Reusable**: Allows you to quickly start new projects with the same structure and setup.

## Naming Convention for Template Repositories

All template repositories should follow a naming convention to identify them easily. The convention is as follows:

- Must start with the prefix `tp-`.
- After the prefix, include an identifier that describes the type of project implemented by the template.

Examples:

- `tp-desktop-app`: Template for a desktop application.
- `tp-web-service`: Template for a web service.
- `tp-react-ts-template`: Template for a project using React and TypeScript.

## How to create a template repository

1. **Create the repository on GitHub or your preferred version control system**:

   When creating the repository, make sure to follow the naming convention, such as `tp-desktop-app`.

2. **Set up the basic functionalities**:

   Include the most common and necessary functionalities for the type of project you are defining, such as configurations, folder structure, and initial dependencies.

3. **Mark it as a template**:

   On GitHub, you can mark the repository as a template by selecting the "Template repository" option in the project settings. This allows others to create new repositories from your template.

4. **Document how to use the template**:

   Be sure to include a `README.md` file that explains how to use the template to start a new project. For example, you can include instructions on how to clone the repository or use it as a template.

## Best practices

- Keep the repository up to date with the latest tools and relevant dependencies.
- Document changes in the template so that developers can better understand its features and how to use them.
